## Singleton

1. Add a private static field to the class for storing the singleton instance.

2. Declare a public static creation method for getting the singleton instance.

3. Implement “lazy initialization” inside the static method. It should create a new object on its first call and put it into the static field. The method should always return that instance on all subsequent calls.

4. Make the constructor of the class private. The static method of the class will still be able to call the constructor, but not the other objects.

5. Go over the client code and replace all direct calls to the singleton’s constructor with calls to its static creation method.

## Buidler

1. Make sure that you can clearly define the common construction steps for building all available product representations. Otherwise, you won’t be able to proceed with implementing the pattern.

2. Declare these steps in the base builder interface.

3. Create a concrete builder class for each of the product representations and implement their construction steps.

    > Don’t forget about implementing a method for fetching the result of the construction. The reason why this method can’t be declared inside the builder interface is that various builders may construct products that don’t have a common interface. Therefore, you don’t know what would be the return type for such a method. However, if you’re dealing with products from a single hierarchy, the fetching method can be safely added to the base interface.

4. Think about creating a director class. It may encapsulate various ways to construct a product using the same builder object.

5. The client code creates both the builder and the director objects. Before construction starts, the client must pass a builder object to the director. Usually, the client does this only once, via parameters of the director’s class constructor. The director uses the builder object in all further construction. There’s an alternative approach, where the builder is passed to a specific product construction method of the director.

6. The construction result can be obtained directly from the director only if all products follow the same interface. Otherwise, the client should fetch the result from the builder.

## Factory method

1. Make all products follow the same interface. This interface should declare methods that make sense in every product.

2. Add an empty factory method inside the creator class. The return type of the method should match the common product interface.

3. In the creator’s code find all references to product constructors. One by one, replace them with calls to the factory method, while extracting the product creation code into the factory method.

    You might need to add a temporary parameter to the factory method to control the type of returned product.

    At this point, the code of the factory method may look pretty ugly. It may have a large `switch` statement that picks which product class to instantiate. But don’t worry, we’ll fix it soon enough.

4. Now, create a set of creator subclasses for each type of product listed in the factory method. Override the factory method in the subclasses and extract the appropriate bits of construction code from the base method.

5. If there are too many product types and it doesn’t make sense to create subclasses for all of them, you can reuse the control parameter from the base class in subclasses.

    For instance, imagine that you have the following hierarchy of classes: the base `Mail` class with a couple of subclasses: `AirMail` and `GroundMail`; the `Transport` classes are `Plane`, `Truck` and `Train`. While the `AirMail` class only uses `Plane` objects, `GroundMail` may work with both `Truck` and `Train` objects. You can create a new subclass (say `TrainMail`) to handle both cases, but there’s another option. The client code can pass an argument to the factory method of the `GroundMail` class to control which product it wants to receive.

6. If, after all of the extractions, the base factory method has become empty, you can make it abstract. If there’s something left, you can make it a default behavior of the method.

## Abstract factory

1. Map out a matrix of distinct product types versus variants of these products.

2. Declare abstract product interfaces for all product types. Then make all concrete product classes implement these interfaces.

3. Declare the abstract factory interface with a set of creation methods for all abstract products.

4. Implement a set of concrete factory classes, one for each product variant.

5. Create factory initialization code somewhere in the app. It should instantiate one of the concrete factory classes, depending on the application configuration or the current environment. Pass this factory object to all classes that construct products.

6. Scan through the code and find all direct calls to product constructors. Replace them with calls to the appropriate creation method on the factory object.

## Prototype

1. Create the prototype interface and declare the `clone` method in it. Or just add the method to all classes of an existing class hierarchy, if you have one.

2. A prototype class must define the alternative constructor that accepts an object of that class as an argument. The constructor must copy the values of all fields defined in the class from the passed object into the newly created instance. If you’re changing a subclass, you must call the parent constructor to let the superclass handle the cloning of its private fields.

    If your programming language doesn’t support method overloading, you won’t be able to create a separate “prototype” constructor. Thus, copying the object’s data into the newly created clone will have to be performed within the `clone` method. Still, having this code in a regular constructor is safer because the resulting object is returned fully configured right after you call the `new` operator.

3. The cloning method usually consists of just one line: running a `new` operator with the prototypical version of the constructor. Note, that every class must explicitly override the cloning method and use its own class name along with the `new` operator. Otherwise, the cloning method may produce an object of a parent class.

4. Optionally, create a centralized prototype registry to store a catalog of frequently used prototypes.

    You can implement the registry as a new factory class or put it in the base prototype class with a static method for fetching the prototype. This method should search for a prototype based on search criteria that the client code passes to the method. The criteria might either be a simple string tag or a complex set of search parameters. After the appropriate prototype is found, the registry should clone it and return the copy to the client.

    Finally, replace the direct calls to the subclasses’ constructors with calls to the factory method of the prototype registry.
